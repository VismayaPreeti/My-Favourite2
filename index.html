        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I like playing chess because it is an inddor sport, so you can play it any time of the year, any time of the day. My dad is the one who introduced me to chess and it is a great social event where you can have fun with your friends who are beginners and also friends that really know how to play well. The better you get in the game, the more fun you have! When I get free time I definetly play with my friends and also my family members.</p>
